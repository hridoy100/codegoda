The acceptance rate is calculated as the number of accepted submissions divided by the total number of submissions.

### Difficulty Analysis
A clearer interpretation of the graph indicates that some problems in the medium section were either easy or difficult. The Prime Properties problem is not particularly challenging to solve, but there are several edge cases that make it challenging to get all the answers correct. On the other hand, the Big Bang solution is not difficult to implement, but it is challenging to prove that the solution is effective. The difficulty level for the other problems in the medium section was fairly consistent. The first two problems in this section were closer in difficulty to the easy section.

Moving to the medium-hard section, Max Booker was the easiest problem, followed by Scale It Up. However, it is important to note that our system detected a high degree of plagiarism in Scale It Up, and when this is taken into account, almost all the questions in the hard section had a similar success rate. The hardest problem in this section was Can Alice Finish the Game.

In the final three problems, which were the same for all contestants, one turned out to be less difficult because the test cases were weak. Given the success rate of the last two problems, they were indeed the most challenging problems in the competition.

It is worth mentioning that only one contestant was able to solve all the test cases for Trip Planner, the hardest problem in the contest.
